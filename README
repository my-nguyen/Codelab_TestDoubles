Advanced Android in Kotlin 05.1:Testing Basics

In branch b5: "Task: Writing Assertions for LiveData", the test won't pass due to Robolectric error
in file test/resources/robolectric.properties, if I set
sdk=31 => "API level 31 is not available"
sdk=30 => "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: android/app/Instrumentation"
sdk=29 => "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: android/util/TypedValue"

since I'm next to the end of the Codelab, I'll proceed to that last step.
